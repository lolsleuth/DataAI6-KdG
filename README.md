## Project Overview

This project includes:

- **P1W2**: Developed a ChatGPT-like chatbot using various LLM APIs, added GUI options, and implemented a local LLM setup with Ollama, enhancing responses with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

- **P1W3**: Built an Aspect-Based Sentiment Analyzer (ABSA) using three methods: SpaCy, a machine learning model, and a local LLM. Outputs were compared to determine the most effective approach for sentiment analysis.

- **P1W4**: Expanded the ABSA with a response generation feature for reviews, creating tailored 'thank you' or 'apology' responses based on sentiment analysis of specific review aspects.
