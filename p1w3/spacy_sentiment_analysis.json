I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could\u2019ve just been their bed. Turns out it\u2019s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn\u2019t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn\u2019t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.",

It has a sensor pad built in that I have used to cook potatoes so it knows how long to cook them you can use it for other foods too. It comes with a great operating manual, actually 2 speperate ones -in English and one in Spanish. I'm still learning all the bells and whistles but I'm very pleased with my purchase.",

The people who left bad reviews because their \"sound stage changed\" and \"it sounds like X, Y, and also Z!\" - take it with a grain of salt. There's a few reasons for this. First and foremost... duh. It's like moving your speaker that was 2 feet away and surrounded in concrete, to 4 feet away and surrounded in wood. Anyone who orders these thinking the sound will not change shouldn't be writing clarity-centric reviews trying to sound like an audiophile. Because an audiophile wouldn't even get these.

I initially thought I\u2019d accidentally gotten a fake but then noticed others reporting this in their reviews.  I guess I should have read them first, but the reason I didn\u2019t was because I had bought a really similar bag from this company in the past; thus, I may not have been discerning enough in reading about this one.

        "Review Body": "As other stated the bass sounds are reduced for music, but works terrific for podcasts etc. The power on power off volume cannot be adjusted and should be turned on or off we\u2019re not attached to your ears. It is very very loud. It is easy to have these headphones too loud when trying to override exterior noises, like on a bus or around other\u2019s loud speech. This could result in tinnitus. However they are terrific for listening to things at low-volume without disturbing others, in bed, while they are on phone, etc. Voice to speech text does not work well with this, and background noises are amplified for persons receiving your phone call. This being said the value for money and comfort is hard to beat. It does not have a volume adjustment on the headset, but this can be completed by pushing them further forward from the years to reduce sound or slid back closer to the year to make the volume louder.  These seem very sturdy, long battery life. I have a small head and sensitive este, these don\u2019t hurt me, very comfortable, leaves enough room behind my head to insert a forefinger yet ride well during activity.  I can also wear sunglasses with them, or one earpiece for two way radio and still get good benefit from the headphones.",

The box was torn apart and worse, a number of chocolate bars were cracked or broken to pieces.  I understand, Amazon has little or no control of products after shipment, but I just had to vent this time.  Sorry Amazon !  Erik M.",

Still a great experience,  but everyone is different so if you\u2019re not into spicy then you should still be cautious because of some people this will be VERY spicy. Enjoy!",

I am pleased with the seat cushion it is soft and not hard plastic. My daughter loves that their are handles for her to hold to feel more comfortable. I definitely recommend for any parent potty training their little one/ones.",

The inside of it is lined with some sort of plastic or rubber, which may be waterproof, but is not breathable. You can test this yourself, put it against your lips and blow. No air passes through. There's a softer fabric over the top, but that's not going to provide any sort of air flow. If you have a mattress that's supposed to be breathable or have a cooling effect, a sheet of plastic between you and it pretty much nullifies the effect.",

Not a fault of the can just for me it would be ideal if it was a few inches taller maybe a slightly higher base or something?",

Instead, I am using the headphone adapter into the 1/8th\" input. It would have been helpful if they had a 1/4\" headphone adapter but it's 2021 and I had one in my electronic archives. (we all have those boxes don't we?). Anyway, latency and quality was similar with HD or LL switch so not sure what the big deal is with that - sounds great. Good headroom, and can use volume on receiver to set level. Watched 30 min of Almost Famous and it never cut out. I got them so I could use the treadmill and watch movies without blasting the house away. perfect.",

The foam design is the key to making this battery organizer genius.

It\u2019s flavor is sound, the ground is fairly uniform, and the container is perfect for bringing to picnics and family gatherings as it\u2019s disposable.  If you absolutely hate the look of the container, it\u2019s easy enough to pour the salt into a prettier dispenser using the large opening at the top of the container, and each 4.4 ounce container is about the right size for fill most salt dispensers.  With 12 containers of salt per pack, you\u2019ll have plenty of salt to season all your entrees.",

I actually liked that it didn't come with any pigtails for anything, so I just disconnected everything from the old light after I removed it from the spoiler. I didn't have to run anything back through the liftgate. The fit is not 100% perfect, as the gap at the edge between the light and the cutout in the spoiler is slightly larger than it needs to be. It's not noticeably off, though. Hard to knock it for the price - $40 plus tax. Cheapest I could find from Nissan was about $123. Next cheapest is Dorman for $90.",

Try it for yourself and you'll understand why everyone over a certain age used to talk about going to the drive in and  drinking malts. SMART GENERATION!!!",

I followed all the instructions to install it and got to the point where you turn the power on and connect it to your network.  When I did that, I didn't get the expected white LED lights on the doorbell. I got some other version that indicated a problem.  When I went to find out what the lights meant, the first time I read that I had an inadequate transformer.  Great! So my first issue with this system is that it can't work with transformers that are already in your house. You have to have a special transformer on your doorbell. If you have anything other than a modern home, you might want to check your transformer before getting this doorbell.  Apparently there is not enough power in the standard transformer for this item.",

The 30 second stutter reminder is a useful feature to time the brushing of each quadrant. There is no auto shutoff after 2 mins, but I don't find this to be consequential. The entire device is washable under running water, which is necessary each time.  I leave the brush in the charger all the time. The absence of more fancy features is really not a big deal. Basic brushing works very well with the design of the brush head and the reasonably quiet motor. I have to see how long this lasts, but I'd recommend this brush highly. Only reservation is that the price seems a little high for this setup.",

I usually wear XL or an XXL if I want it a lil roomier. So, I bought the PLUS on both of them. The dark blue was perfect, but the black was tighter in the waist. Its fine if you dont have tummy issues. But if you do, it will be too tight on your tummy. You must be very careful washing these because they both bleed..even in cold water. And you DO NOT want to dry. These will shrink...a lot!  So all in all, they are spectacular looking...with lots of detail. The black have small beeds on it...making it VERY eye catching. Both have lace on the bottom. Very swishy and feminine. The blue kinda looks like jean material, but isnt. Deninitely worth the buy!!",

They\u2019re probably not waterproof but my toes don\u2019t get wet in an inch or 2 of snow like in my old shoes. Support is excellent, probably why they feel stiff. But will probably loosen up over time.  My othodics provide arch support so I can\u2019t rate these on that issue. These are trail shoes as they claim and not running shoes. Good enough.",

That way I didn\u2019t have to take them off after I got them on. I used a credit card to get out any bubbles and smooth them out. I wanted it to look more like wallpaper on the one wall. Love how they turned out and have gotten a ton of compliments on them.",

I can't REALLY fault that, since... I mean, I've gotten bad bags from the grocery store too, but... still, kind of a points deduction there, plus the lack of care in packaging. Otherwise good.",

Ignoring the instruction, the juicer is actually easy to put together and very easy to clean with the included brushes. It is sturdy and the noise level is fine for what it does. The juice tastes great and, judged by the dryness of the pulp, this juicer offers maximum amount of juice. I already figure out a favorite receipt for the hot days. Two medium size carrots, one apple, two handful kale, one small piece of ginger and a slice of lemon. Absolutely loves it.",

Initial tests throughout the house were in the 6.5 range even though I have been running a radon exhauster for several years on a 6 hour per day schedule.  I upped this to 8 hours which lowered the reading a little. Tested the unit outside which showed a .62 reading. Getting concerned, I purchased and installed a Honeywell ERV.  After some experimental checking, I have the ERV on low continuous, furnace fans on circulate and the radon exhauster on 2 hrs morning and 2 hours evening.  Radon now at about 2.0.  3,000 SF house air is much fresher and radon level is good - basement,  main level and upper master bedroom, all uniform at about 2.0.  I now have at our lake house.  Outside reading = .2.  Need to see what inside reading looks like this summer when closed up with a/c on.",

Put them in a top box with a 3/4 in osb with 2 vent holes in it for the heat to get in the hives. 3 in vents with mesh screen over the holes. They were very happy bee's. They do get very warm but with the separation to the hives made it perfect for them. So I got more and ceramic light fixtures for them so I can get them in the rest of my hives before winter comes again with the sub zero Temps. Now I can keep bee's through the winters now.",

        "Review Body": "I love this product! I would definitely buy them again. I was looking for a way to clean 20 yrs of smoke and nicotine off my walls. Anyone who has ever done this knows just how difficult of a task it is. None of the various spray cleaning products I tried would work. I even tried using a vinegar solution without success. Out of desperation I tried a regular magic eraser on a test spot as a last resort before giving up and it came right off with little to no scrubbing! So when I saw they made a mop I just had to order a box. It absolutely worked wonders.  I did not use them on a mop handle though. I was working on the walls in my hallway and since its close quarters I found I had more control without one. I didn't even need to use any kind of soap with them, just a little water. The only improvement I feel would be necessary would be to make the magic eraser part of the sponge mop head a little thicker. I was afraid it wasn't going to be thick enough but it still got the job done.",

I was initially concerned about the quality since the price was so affordable. However, I\u2019m really impressed with the quality and design of the tuxedo. It looks exactly as shown in the pictures and the quality is very superb.  The fabric feels just as nice at the ones you rent but you get to keep yours and wear it over and over again!  The pants are unhemmed so you can get your local tailor to hem them to meet your preferred length.  Overall, I give this a thousand stars because the tux is very well made, the price is super affordable and the customer service is superb.  They respond to your questions very quickly and help you find the right size based on your body measurements.  I love them so much that I ordered eight of them for my groom and all his groomsmen for our upcoming wedding.  I highly recommend this tuxedo.  Father\u2019s day is coming up and this is an excellent option for a father\u2019s day gift.  You can use it for weddings, funerals, Prom, Formal dinners, Cruises and just about any occasion.",

Decided to see what's new in the world of lighter technology and saw these newfangled plasma arc lighters and had to give it a try. This brand seems to have the most established presence, and I chose this model because of the extra safety slider over the activation button (seems a bit more failsafe when this goes into a drawer). The lighter does the job just fine, lighting candles with ease. We've already made use of it several times due to a couple recent unexpected power outages. Not sure how well the tip will stand up over time, but it's nice not having to get butane refills.",
