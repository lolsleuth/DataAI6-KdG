        "content": "Hardcore Arch Linux users are known for their gatekeeping mentality and pride in self-sufficiency. For many, using Arch Linux is as much about the philosophy as it is about the functionality. Arch users tend to view their OS as a tool that requires dedication, technical knowledge, and a willingness to solve problems independently. If you’re not willing to dive deep into the Arch Wiki or figure things out on your own, they’ll likely tell you Arch isn’t for you.\n\nIn the Arch community, there’s a clear disdain for 'hand-holding' OSs and a strong preference for the DIY (do-it-yourself) approach. Arch users often believe that real Linux users don’t rely on graphical installers or automatic configurations. Instead, they take pride in building and customizing their system from scratch, knowing every detail of its setup and operation. This leads to a certain level of exclusivity; Arch is considered by some to be a badge of honor in the Linux world, only for those who are 'worthy' of its complexity.\n\nAnother core part of the Arch mentality is the belief in rolling releases and living on the cutting edge, even if that means things can break occasionally. For Arch users, managing updates and potential issues is part of the experience—something they embrace rather than shy away from. Many Arch users also see the command line as a necessary tool, not a nuisance, and they expect fellow users to be comfortable with it too.\n\nOverall, hardcore Arch users value control, customization, and deep understanding of their system. They’re typically quick to encourage newcomers to 'read the Arch Wiki' before asking questions, and they view any reliance on external help as a sign that Arch may not be the right OS for that person."
