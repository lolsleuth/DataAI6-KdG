        "Review Body": "I wanted to like the bed and at first it worked great, it fit perfectly in my dogs crate and he seemed to be comfortable enough with it. HOWEVER, it sheds like CRAZY! I had read a review talking about that, but I decided to buy it anyways cus it could\u2019ve just been their bed. Turns out it\u2019s mine too. Every single day I would have to vacuum inside and around on the outside of his crate because the fur balls that would come off the bed were so much that they would get carried out around the living room (where the crates at) by the normal inside air. It was so annoying. Not to mention my dog has allergies and the amount of fur that came off the bed was very uncomfortable for him to the point he couldn\u2019t sleep in his crate with that bed. It was a problem for me because his crate doesn\u2019t have a base (it was a hand-me-down crate) so the bed had to be there or he would be even more uncomfortable. Anyway, point is this bed although seemed to work for the price, now has to been thrown away because it is completely useless to me and no amount of vacuuming stops the fur from coming off. I imagine the bed would have to be furless for that to happen. So waste of money there.",
